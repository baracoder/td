This is my collection of scripts to manage todo lists.
I was searching for an easy way how to manage todos. But the most tools
were to hard to use. I often forgot what todo, before I could write it
down.
So I made some simple wrappers for powerfull tools like grep and diff.


INSTALLATION
============

1. clone this git
2. add the bin directory to your PATH variable


USAGE
=====

Each line in the file is a todo entry expect lines starting with "#".
They will be ignored. They are usefull as modelines for editor and so
on.


* ta
    Lets you add new lines to the file.

* te
    This script set lets you use your favorite editor to write your
    todos in a simple txt file. After that it checks if some entries are
    removed.  Removed entries will go to the done.txt list.

* tl [regex]
    Lists all the entries in the file. If you add a regex it wil only
    show matching entries.

* report [timespan]
    NOT IMPLEMENTED yet..
    Lets you generate a report on done todos for the last week (1w) or
    whatever you want.

TIPPS
=====

* add 'tl' to your bashrc to remind you every time you open a terminal
* changing the the text of a todo will result in a new todo and the old
  marked as done
